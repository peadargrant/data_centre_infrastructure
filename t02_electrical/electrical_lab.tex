\begin{enumerate}

\item Calculate the voltage developed across a \SI{6}{\kilo\ohm} resistor with \SI{105}{\milli\ampere} flowing through it.

\item The current on a server PSU's \SI{5}{\volt} rail is measured as \SI{4}{\ampere}. What power is being delivered by the PSU?

\item Write an expression for $P$ using only $R$ and $I$.

\item A load consumes \SI{60}{\watt} of power from a \SI{12}{\volt} battery.  Calculate the current.

\item The AC mains supply in Ireland has a frequency of \SI{50}{\hertz}. Calculate the period of the AC waveform.

\item Trains in parts of Europe are supplied with \SI{15}{\kilo\volt} AC at 16 \SI[quotient-mode=fraction]{2/3}{\hertz}. How often does the AC cycle repeat?

\item An unknown mains supply is measured to be sinusoidal with an amplitude of \SI{339.4}{\volt} and a frequency of \SI{50}{\hertz}. Describe this supply in the conventional form.
