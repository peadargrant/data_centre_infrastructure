Answer all questions. 

Specific interest areas for study: 

1.
	(a)	Critical, essential and discretionary loads? 
	(b) UPS Sizing [PF=0.8] 
	(c) UPS types [Standby, Line interactive, Double conversion]
	
2.
	(a)	COP 
	(b) N+1 cooling 
	(c) Efficiency improvements

Equations:
- No need to learn complex magnus formula.
- Assume you know:
	(1)	P=VI
	(2)	V=RI
	(3) Power Factor
	(4)	COP calculation
	(5) COP / EER conversion [best to learn this, not EER itself]

Also know expected ranges for COP, EER, PF etc.
