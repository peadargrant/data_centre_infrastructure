\begin{enumerate}

\item Calculate the reliability, $R$, of a system at time $t=\SI{20}{\days}$ assuming that it experiences 0.1 failures per day. %\answer{0.135}.

\item A system has 5 failures over the course of a year. Calculate the MTBF in days. %\answer{\SI{73}{\days}}

\item A system has an MTBF of \SI{150}{\days}. How many faults may be expected over the course of two years. %\answer{4.9}

\item Calculate the inherent availability, $A_i$, of a system with a mean time between failure of \SI{120}{\days} and a mean time to repair of \SI{12}{\hours}. %\answer{\SI{99.59}{\percent}}
